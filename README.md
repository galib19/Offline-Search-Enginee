# Offline-Search-Enginee

This project aims to build an optimizing time efficient offline search engine for Linux or Windows operating
system respectively. We often face difficulties to use default operating systemâ€™s search engine. Like as, it
takes too much time for searching. Sometimes we could not find our desired files. This tool mainly
concentrates on overcoming that time-wasting process with a little loss of memory.
